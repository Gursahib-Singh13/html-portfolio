      It is Very difficult to choose the Favourite part but if I have to choose
      the it will be this part<br />
      like its previous part the movie is full of comedy and watching Mr.Bean
      playing a character like james bond is just mind blowing.

      Amazing Storyline<br />a rollercoaster ride of emotions, really good
      soundtracks and after you will watch this part of the series then you will
      understand the true nature of Rocket<br />
      Highly Recommende Movie<br />
      and I will suggest that after watching this movie do watch the Vol. 1 and
      Vol. 2 again.
